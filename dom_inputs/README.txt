These are input files you can use to test your dominating set program:

 icayley.txt    cayley graphs
 ifootball.txt  Football Pool Problem Graphs
 ifullerene.txt Fullerenes
 ikneser.txt    Kneser Graphs
 iqueen.txt     Queen Graphs

These have succinct representations of minimum dominating sets
and can be useful for checking your answers:

 ocayley.txt   
 ofootball.txt  
 ofullerene.txt  
 okneser.txt   
 oqueen.txt   

These have output format that matches what you are supposed to have
for assignment #2. Note that this output format is the same as your
input format for assignment #1. So if you like you can use the program
you wrote for assignment #1 to check your answers.

 cert_cayley.txt  
 cert_football.txt  
 cert_fullerene.txt  
 cert_kneser.txt  
 cert_queen.txt
